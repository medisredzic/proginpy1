#
# Start of code block that should not be modified.

# The next 3 lines will ask the user for input through the console and set the variables var1 and var2
# to the corresponding input values. The variables will be initially of datatype string, so if you want to do
# numerical computations with them you will need to convert them to datatype int or float. See the assignment
# sheet for more details.
var1 = input("Enter var1: ")
var2 = input("Enter var2: ")

#
# End of code block that should not be modified.
#

# Place your code here.

#
# Do not modify the code below this line.
#

# This will print the result to the console.
